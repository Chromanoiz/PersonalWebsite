      In 2021, I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a degree in Computer Science. During my
      studies I mostly focused on algorithms, databases, and AI with coding languages such as Python, C++, and Java.
      These days I am delving more into web development with Angular and C#, as I found I love creating intuitive,
      aesthetically pleasing user interfaces while also incorporating the use of APIs.

    <p>
      At the moment, I am looking to start off my career as a software developer and am open to job opportunities!
      I am a detail-oriented programmer who loves to work with users to create projects that will help them and make
      their lives easier in the process. My love for programming is rooted in my love for solving problems and
      desire to learn and expand my knowledge! If I sound like a good fit, please feel free to contact me!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I am away from my desk, I am usually finding new restaurants and cafes to try delicious food at, tending to
      my houseplants, and going to drift events!
